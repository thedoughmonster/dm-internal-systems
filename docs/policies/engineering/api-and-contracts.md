# API and Contracts Standard

## Rules

- Define request/response shapes explicitly and keep contract behavior stable.
- Treat schema/contract files as canonical for machine-consumed artifacts.
- Version or document compatibility impact when changing contracts.
- Validate contract updates as part of normal change validation.
