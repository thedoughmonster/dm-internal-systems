# Testing and Validation Standard

## Rules

- Run validation proportional to change risk (lint/typecheck/tests/contract checks).
- Behavior changes should include automated verification when feasible.
- Do not treat unrelated pre-existing failures as successful validation.
- Record executed validation commands and outcomes in changelog or review notes.
