# UI and Accessibility Standard

## Rules

- Reuse shared UI primitives and established design tokens where available.
- Maintain semantic structure and keyboard accessibility for interactive controls.
- Keep empty/loading/error states explicit and consistent.
- Preserve responsive behavior across supported viewport ranges.
