# Startup And Discovery

## Startup actions

1. Confirm role assignment and required reading.
2. List non archived sessions in numbered form.
3. If unrelated `ultra` session exists, stop and request direction.
4. If Auditor created `ultra` auto run session, proceed immediately.
5. Validate selected task contract before edits.
6. Restate objective and request operator confirmation before implementation.

## Discovery rules

Auditor executes either:

- specific task path provided by operator, or
- single auto run task created by Auditor
