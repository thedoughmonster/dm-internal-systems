# Session Summary

Date (UTC) and scope: 2026-01-31, documentation authority and changelog policy

Summary of intent:
- Codify documentation authority in README and clarify changelog requirements in AGENTS.

Files created or modified by this run:
- `README.md`: add documentation authority section and start here list.
- `AGENTS.md`: add documentation and changelog requirements plus doc lifecycle status.
- `changelog/20260131T104030Z_session_summary.md`: record this session.

Decisions made:
- Changelogs are the required operational record and canonical docs may lag.
- Lifecycle docs are reference and intake guidance, not workflow gates.

Validation performed:
- Ensure only README.md and AGENTS.md changed besides this changelog entry.
- Check for em dash characters in modified files.
- Review git diff and git status.

Notes on constraints respected:
- No em dash characters in new content.
- Only README.md and AGENTS.md modified, plus required root changelog entry.
