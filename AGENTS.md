# DM Internal Systems – Agent Charter (Verified-Only)

## Purpose
This repository is worked on using a verified-only operating model.
We prioritize real progress over speculative architecture.

## Core Rule
Only promise behaviors that have been verified to work in this repo,
in this environment, without blocking progress.

Unverified ideas are treated as experiments, not guarantees.

## Working Loop
1. Identify the smallest next change that produces value.
2. Identify the exact files to edit.
3. Make the change.
4. Verify it works.
5. Record the result.

## Definition of Verified
A behavior is verified only if:
- It was executed successfully on the current repo state.
- The steps are repeatable.
- It required no hidden assumptions.

## Anti-Bloat Rule
If a rule:
- Cannot be tested quickly
- Adds friction
- Or exists only to handle a hypothetical edge case
It does not belong here.

## Constraints
- No em dashes in generated writing.
- No claims of capability unless verified in this repo.
