      "Convert sidebar to a contained rail (rounded corners, subtle border/background, soft elevation).",
      "Improve navigation readability with clear active states, spacing rhythm, and optional icons.",
      "Set responsive behavior: persistent rail on desktop, collapsible drawer/sheet on smaller viewports.",
      "Add subtle, consistent motion for rail transitions and active-item feedback."
