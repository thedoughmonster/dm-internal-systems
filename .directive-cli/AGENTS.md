# DM Internal Systems – Agent Charter (Entrypoint)

This file is the startup entrypoint.
Canonical machine-operational rules are policy JSON files under `.directive-cli/policies/` and lifecycle scripts under `.directive-cli/scripts/directives/`.

## Role assignment requirement

All new conversations or threads must begin with explicit role assignment unless role is already fixed by startup context.

When startup context is provided by `dc agent start` role bundle (and optional `*.startup.json` in bundle sources), role assignment is already satisfied. Do not ask for role again.

Only ask:

Which role am I being assigned?
1. Architect
2. Executor
3. Pair
4. Auditor

when role is not already fixed by startup context or valid handoff.

Exception:
- A valid session-local `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` targeting the receiver role counts as explicit role assignment.

## Required reading

- Primary startup context must come from `.codex/context/startup.md`, generated by `dc agent bootstrap` or `dc agent start` before Codex launch.
- Canonical dc command surface must come from bundled `.codex/context/dc.commands.json` (embedded in startup context).
- If no compiled bundle is active, read `apps/web/docs/guides/component-paradigm.md` and selected role `README.md`.
- If compiled bundle is active, treat included files as already read. Do not re-open bundle source files unless operator requests deep audit or specific source verification.
- If startup context includes selected directive/task, use them as active execution context and skip manual repository-wide session/task discovery.

## Operator discovery gate

- Before any command execution or file edits, run an operator discovery check:
  - intended outcome
  - hard constraints and excluded scope
  - definition of done and validation evidence
  - explicit go-ahead to execute now
- Do not run commands until operator gives explicit go-ahead.
- If any `dc` command usage is uncertain, run help first; do not guess command names or flags.

## Operational source of truth

Operational procedure is script-owned:
- `dc runbook ...`
- `dc directive start|finish ...`
- `dc task start|finish ...`

If markdown procedure text conflicts with runtime script behavior, script behavior wins.

## Canonical machine policies

- `.directive-cli/policies/core.policy.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/executor.lifecycle.policy.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/architect.authoring.policy.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/runbook.flow.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/handoff.schema.json`

Validate policies with:
- `dc policy validate`

## Directive model

- Session root: `apps/web/.local/directives/<session_dir>/`
- Session file: `<directive_slug>.meta.json`
- Task file: `<task_slug>.task.json`
- Handoff file: `<directive_slug>.handoff.json`

## Metadata tooling policy

Do not edit directive metadata manually in normal flow.
Use tooling:
- `dc directive new`
- `dc directive task`
- `dc directive handoff`
- `dc meta architect`
- `dc meta executor`
- `dc validate`

Directive intake policy:
- Capture operator goals during `dc directive new` (interactive goal lines or repeatable `--goal` flags).
- Store goals in session metadata as `meta.goals` and preserve them during later metadata updates.

## Execution context gate

Executor may execute when context is provided by either:
- valid session-local handoff artifact, or
- operator-selected session/task through `dc` lifecycle commands.

## Data access rule

- UI reads and writes go through Edge Functions.
- Do not call Supabase REST endpoints directly from UI code.
- Local directives UI exception: local reads/writes in `apps/web/.local/directives/`.

## Secret handling (mandatory)

- Never print secret values in chat output.
- Redact secrets as `[REDACTED]`.
- If uncertain whether a value is secret, redact.

## Changelog rule

- Sessions touching root scope add one entry under `changelog/`.
- Sessions touching `apps/web` add one entry under `apps/web/changelog/`.
