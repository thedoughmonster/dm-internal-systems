    "summary": "Normalize directive governance for collections, branch lifecycle, commit policy, and merge safety. Architect defines branch lifecycle while Executor performs state-changing git by default. Commit checkpoints follow explicit `commit_policy` (`per_task`, `per_collection`, or `end_of_directive`) with no implicit per-task default. Collection completion uses `collection_commit_label` when commit policy requires collection checkpoints. Architect startup detects completed unmerged directives and issues Executor merge instruction only after merge-safety evidence is present. Active blocked or in-progress directive branches may remain open when tracked in metadata, while untracked stale branches are forbidden. Collection completion requires explicit non-breaking merge-to-`dev` evidence and fail-closed enforcement in agent rules.",
