# DM Internal Systems – Agent Charter (Entrypoint)

This file is the startup entrypoint.
Canonical machine-operational rules are policy JSON files under `.directive-cli/policies/` and lifecycle scripts under `.directive-cli/scripts/directives/`.

## Role assignment requirement

All new conversations or threads must begin with explicit role assignment unless role is already fixed by startup context.

When startup context is provided by `dc launch codex` (or `dc context start`) role bundle (and optional `*.startup.json` in bundle sources), role assignment is already satisfied. Do not ask for role again.

Only ask:

Which role am I being assigned?
1. Architect
2. Executor
3. Pair
4. Auditor

when role is not already fixed by startup context or valid handoff.

Exception:
- A valid session-local `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` targeting the receiver role counts as explicit role assignment.

## Required reading

- Primary startup context must come from `.codex/context/startup.md`, generated by `dc context bootstrap` or `dc launch codex` (`dc context start`) before Codex launch.
- Canonical dc command surface must come from bundled `.codex/context/dc.commands.json` (embedded in startup context).
- If no compiled bundle is active, read `apps/web/docs/guides/component-paradigm.md` and selected role `README.md`.
- If compiled bundle is active, treat included files as already read. Do not re-open bundle source files unless operator requests deep audit or specific source verification.
- If startup context includes selected directive/task, use them as active execution context and skip manual repository-wide session/task discovery.

## Operator discovery gate

- Before any command execution or file edits, run an operator discovery check:
  - intended outcome
  - hard constraints and excluded scope
  - definition of done and validation evidence
  - explicit go-ahead to execute now
- Do not run commands until operator gives explicit go-ahead.
- Architect default mode is conversational discovery; do not begin task authoring until operator explicitly approves scope and direction.
- If any `dc` command usage is uncertain, run help first; do not guess command names or flags.

## Operational source of truth

Operational procedure is script-owned:
- `dc runbook ...`
- `dc directive start|finish ...`
- `dc task start|finish ...`
- Preferred directive finalization: `dc runbook executor-directive-closeout --session <s> --confirm executor-directive-closeout`

If markdown procedure text conflicts with runtime script behavior, script behavior wins.

## Canonical machine policies

- `.directive-cli/policies/core.policy.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/executor.lifecycle.policy.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/architect.authoring.policy.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/runbook.flow.json`
- `.directive-cli/policies/handoff.schema.json`

Validate policies with:
- `dc policy validate`

## Directive model

- Session root: `.directive-cli/directives/<session_dir>/`
- Session file: `<directive_slug>.meta.json`
- Task file: `<task_slug>.task.json`
- Handoff file: `<directive_slug>.handoff.json`

## Metadata tooling policy

Do not edit directive metadata manually in normal flow.
Use tooling:
- `dc directive new`
- `dc directive task`
- `dc directive handoff`
- `dc meta architect`
- `dc meta executor`
- `dc validate`

Directive intake policy:
- Capture operator goals during `dc directive new` (interactive goal lines or repeatable `--goal` flags).
- Store goals in session metadata as `meta.goals` and preserve them during later metadata updates.

## Execution context gate

Executor may execute when context is provided by either:
- valid session-local handoff artifact, or
- operator-selected session/task through `dc` lifecycle commands.

## Data access rule

- UI reads and writes go through Edge Functions.
- Do not call Supabase REST endpoints directly from UI code.
- Local directives UI exception: local reads/writes in `.directive-cli/directives/`.

## Secret handling (mandatory)

- Never print secret values in chat output.
- Redact secrets as `[REDACTED]`.
- If uncertain whether a value is secret, redact.

## Changelog rule

- Sessions touching root scope add one entry under `changelog/`.
- Sessions touching `apps/web` add one entry under `apps/web/changelog/`.

## Role bindings

- Architect: `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/architect/README.md`
- Executor: `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/executor/README.md`
- Pair: `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/pair/README.md`
- Auditor: `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/auditor/README.md`

# Shared Rules Modules

Status: active
These modules are mandatory for all roles.

## Required read order

1. `critical-enforcement.md`
2. `role-handoff-automation.md`
3. `baseline-and-safety.md`
4. `directives-model.md`

## Usage

Role docs must reference shared modules instead of duplicating baseline policy.

```

## Source: .directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/shared/baseline-and-safety.md

```markdown
# Baseline And Safety

## Baseline anchors

All roles follow baseline policy defined in `.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`.

- verified only operating model
- changelog requirements when applicable
- role assignment and required reading protocol
- secret handling and redaction policy

## Data access policy

- All UI reads and writes go through Edge Functions.
- Direct Supabase REST calls from UI code are forbidden.
- Approved local exception: `/directives` UI may read and write `.directive-cli/directives/` directly for local use.

## Migration naming policy

- Migration filename format: `YYYYMMDDhhmmss_description.sql`
- `T` and `Z` are not allowed in migration filenames.

```

## Source: .directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/shared/critical-enforcement.md

```markdown
# Critical Enforcement

These rules are non negotiable. Every role must enforce them exactly.

## Critical rules

1. Role lock
- Role is selected at session start and does not change mid session.
- If requested work requires another role, use automatic handoff protocol from `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/shared/role-handoff-automation.md`.

2. Required reading gate
- Required reading must be completed before any substantive action.
- If required reading cannot be completed, stop.

3. Verified only gate
- Do not claim capability or validation unless executed in this repository.
- If verification cannot be run, state that explicitly and stop any claim of certainty.

4. Secret safety gate
- Never print secrets in chat output.
- Redact sensitive values in logs, diffs, and diagnostics.
- If command output may expose secrets, do not run it without explicit operator approval.

5. Data access gate
- UI reads and writes must use Edge Functions.
- Direct Supabase REST calls from UI code are forbidden.
- Local `/directives` UI file access exception is allowed.

6. Directive contract gate
- Work must follow explicit Objective, Constraints, Allowed files, Steps, Validation, Expected output, and Stop conditions when using directives.
- If contract is incomplete for safe execution, stop and request clarification.
- Missing required commit checkpoint or unresolved merge-safety evidence is fail-closed and blocks continuation.

7. Git authority gate
- During directive sessions, state-changing git commands are Executor-owned by default.
- Architect may run state-changing git commands only on `chore/*` branches, with explicit operator instruction or explicit directive task instruction.
- Exception: Architect may create and switch to the directive branch only when it is a `chore/*` branch, as part of directive setup prior to Executor handoff.
- Architect `chore/*` state-changing git is limited to governance and housekeeping assets only: `.directive-cli/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/**`, `changelog/**`, `apps/web/changelog/**`, and `.directive-cli/directives/**`.
- If planned or staged files include product code, Architect must stop and hand off to Executor before any state-changing git.
- Architect state-changing commits on `chore/*` must use commit subject prefix `chore(architect):`.
- Architect must not run state-changing git on `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `dev`, or `prod`.
- Non-Executor roles other than Architect may use read-only git inspection commands only.
- If state-changing git is required outside these rules, write `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` for the next role or request explicit operator role reset.

8. Unexpected changes gate
- If unexpected working tree changes are detected, stop immediately and report.
- Exception: changes explicitly declared through handoff `worktree_mode: known_dirty_allowlist` and exact `worktree_allowlist_paths` are treated as expected for that handoff only.

9. Governance ownership gate
- Governance rule updates in `.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/**`, and `apps/web/docs/guides/agent-guidance.md` are Architect-owned.
- For governance-only rule updates, Architect executes end to end on a dedicated `chore/*` branch and does not hand off implementation to Executor.

## Fail closed behavior

When any critical rule is violated or cannot be satisfied:

- stop immediately
- report the blocking rule and affected files
- request explicit operator direction before proceeding

No silent continuation is allowed.

## Override protocol

- Overrides must be explicit in chat from the operator.
- Apply only the minimum scope required by the override.
- Do not generalize one override to other rules or tasks.

```

## Source: .directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/shared/directives-model.md

```markdown
# Directives Model

## Storage model

- Session root: `.directive-cli/directives/<session_dir>/`
- Session intake content: `<directive_slug>.meta.json` (non executable)
- Session intake metadata: `<directive_slug>.meta.json`
- Executable task content: `<task_slug>.task.json`
- Executable task metadata: `<task_slug>.task.json`
- Execution handoff artifact (required): `<directive_slug>.handoff.json`

## Procedure precedence

- Lifecycle scripts and runbooks are the canonical execution procedure:
  - `dc runbook ...`
  - `dc directive start|finish ...`
  - `dc task start|finish ...`
- If procedural prose conflicts with lifecycle script behavior, lifecycle scripts and runbooks win.

Session identity rules:

- Session directory names are human-readable and unique.
- Canonical session UUID is stored in `<directive_slug>.meta.json` as `meta.id`.

Pairing rules:

- Session metadata file name is `<directive_slug>.meta.json`.
- Task file names are `<task_slug>.task.json`.
- Handoff file name is `<directive_slug>.handoff.json`.

## Task minimum contract

Every executable task must include:

- Objective
- Constraints
- Allowed files
- Steps
- Validation
- Expected output
- Stop conditions

## Task metadata minimums

Every executable task must include at least:

- `title`
- `status`
- `priority`
- `session_priority`
- `summary`
- `execution_model`
- `thinking_level`

## Task result update contract

- Executor is the only role that may write task `meta.result`.
- Executor may update `meta.result` only for the task file that was executed.
- Task `meta.result` must include:
  - `summary`: one line factual outcome
  - `validation`: commands run and pass or fail outcomes, or explicit not-run reason
  - `updated`: UTC timestamp
- Executor must not manually modify task `meta.bucket` or session `<directive_slug>.meta.json` metadata.
- Lifecycle commands `dc task start` and `dc task finish` may update task `meta.status` and task `meta.updated`.
- Architect reconciles task and session metadata after execution by using Executor `meta.result` evidence.
- Completion metadata must not be set to done when required validation evidence is missing or failing.

## Collection metadata minimums

If a task belongs to a collection, task metadata must include:

- `collection_id`
- `collection_title`
- `collection_order`
- `collection_commit_label`
- `collection_merge_ready`

Collection rules:

- `collection_id` must be stable within the session and reused by all tasks in the same collection.
- `collection_order` must be an integer starting at `1` for ordering inside a collection.
- `collection_commit_label` must be a short, commit-safe token used for collection completion checkpoint commits.
- `collection_merge_ready` remains `false` until merge-safety evidence is complete.
- A collection is valid only when all tasks in that collection can merge to `dev` without breaking verified behavior.

## Directive branch and commit policy metadata

Session `<directive_slug>.meta.json` metadata must include:

- `directive_branch`
- `directive_base_branch`
- `directive_merge_status`
- `commit_policy`

Session goal metadata:

- `meta.goals` is optional but recommended.
- When present, `meta.goals` must be an array of non-empty one-line strings.
- Goals are operator intent anchors and should be preserved through task drafting, handoff, and reconciliation.

Branch metadata rules:

- `directive_branch` must be a non empty string.
- Missing or empty `directive_branch` blocks drafting and execution (fail closed).

Value conventions:

- `directive_base_branch`: typically `dev`
- `directive_merge_status`: `open`, `merge_ready`, `merged`, `blocked`
- `commit_policy`: `per_task`, `per_collection`, `end_of_directive`

Lifecycle rules:

- Architect defines branch lifecycle requirements in the directive.
- Architect must ensure `directive_branch` exists before handing off execution.
- `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` for directive execution must include `handoff.directive_branch`.
- Executor must verify it is on `directive_branch` before any edits; `dc directive start` may create missing local branch from `directive_base_branch` according to directive metadata.
- State-changing branch operations are executed by Executor by default, with Architect `chore/*` exception governed by `.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`.
- Completed directives with unmerged branches must be surfaced during Architect startup and resolved or explicitly blocked.
- Open branches are allowed for active blocked or in-progress directives when tracked in session metadata. Untracked stale directive branches are forbidden.

Commit policy rules:

- Do not assume per-task commits.
- If `commit_policy` is `per_collection`, collection completion requires a labeled checkpoint commit using `collection_commit_label`.
- If `commit_policy` is `end_of_directive`, task completion may occur without intermediate commits.
- Missing or invalid `commit_policy` blocks execution.

## Collection merge-safety evidence

`collection_merge_ready` may be treated as satisfied only when evidence includes:

- all tasks in the collection are complete
- required validation commands for the collection passed in this repository
- no unresolved blocking risks that would make merge unsafe
- explicit statement that merge to `dev` is expected to be non-breaking based on executed validation

## Status and priority conventions

- `session_priority`: `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `priority`: `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `status`: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`, `archived`
- `ultra` is reserved for Auditor.

## Priority resolution order

- Global scheduling is determined by session `session_priority`.
- Task `priority` is scoped to ordering tasks inside the selected session only.
- A task in a higher priority session outranks any task in a lower priority session, regardless of task priority values.

```

## Source: .directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/shared/role-handoff-automation.md

```markdown
# Role Handoff Automation

This module defines automatic handoff behavior when a role boundary is reached.

## Handoff contract

Automatic handoff is valid only when sender writes a complete session-local handoff artifact.

Required artifact path:

- `.directive-cli/directives/<session_dir>/<directive_slug>.handoff.json`

Required `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` format:

```json
{
  "handoff": {
    "from_role": "<architect|executor|pair|auditor>",
    "to_role": "<architect|executor|pair|auditor>",
    "trigger": "<short deterministic trigger id>",
    "session_id": "<directive session UUID from <directive_slug>.meta.json meta.id or null>",
    "task_file": "<task path or null>",
    "directive_branch": "<non empty git branch name>",
    "required_reading": "apps/web/docs/guides/component-paradigm.md",
    "objective": "<one line objective for receiving role>",
    "blocking_rule": "<rule that prevents sender from continuing>",
    "worktree_mode": "<clean_required|known_dirty_allowlist>",
    "worktree_allowlist_paths": []
  }
}
```

Directive execution rule:

- For any handoff that leads to directive execution, `handoff.directive_branch` must be present and be a non empty git branch name.
- `handoff.directive_branch` must match session metadata `meta.directive_branch` when `handoff.session_id` points at a directive session.
- `handoff.worktree_mode` must be explicit for directive execution handoffs:
  - `clean_required`: execution requires clean working tree before edits.
  - `known_dirty_allowlist`: execution may proceed only when dirty paths match `worktree_allowlist_paths` exactly.
- For `clean_required`, set `handoff.worktree_allowlist_paths: []`.
- For `known_dirty_allowlist`, `handoff.worktree_allowlist_paths` must be a non empty JSON array of exact relative paths.

Rules:

- Chat handoffs are not allowed.
- Receiver must treat `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` as the sole handoff source of truth.
- `handoff.directive_branch` must match session metadata `meta.directive_branch`.
- `handoff.worktree_mode` must be present for directive execution handoffs.
- If `handoff.worktree_mode` is `known_dirty_allowlist`, `handoff.worktree_allowlist_paths` must be present and non empty.
- If `handoff.worktree_mode` is `clean_required`, `handoff.worktree_allowlist_paths` must be `[]`.
- If `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` is missing, incomplete, or mismatched, Executor must stop.

## Sender behavior

When a handoff trigger is met, sender must:

1. stop execution immediately
2. write one complete `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` artifact
3. avoid additional discretionary work after artifact write

## Receiver behavior

When a valid `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` targets receiver role:

1. treat target role as explicitly selected
2. complete required reading
3. continue execution without requesting manual role re-selection
4. use `handoff.session_id` and `handoff.task_file` to continue directly
5. verify current git branch matches `handoff.directive_branch` before any edits
6. when handoff context resolves execution target, do not request additional operator confirmation prompts before starting execution

If `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` is incomplete or malformed, receiver must stop and request correction.

## No-manual-confirmation mode

For trigger-based handoffs defined in this module, role transition should not require additional operator confirmation.

Operator may still interrupt or override at any time.

TTY transition clarification:

- Automatic handoff applies to artifact and role context (`<directive_slug>.handoff.json` and startup context), not guaranteed in-process CLI reattachment.
- If launch command is running in a non-interactive environment, sender must instruct operator to:
  1. exit current Codex session
  2. run `dc launch handoff --role <receiver> --from-role <sender> --profile <profile> --directive <session>` from a real terminal (TTY)

## Trigger matrix

1. Architect to Executor
- trigger: `architect_ultra_detected`
- condition: any non archived session with `meta.session_priority: ultra`

2. Auditor to Executor
- trigger: `auditor_ultra_open`
- condition: ultra priority enforcement task requires execution role

3. Executor to Architect
- trigger: `executor_scope_or_contract_block`
- condition: allowlist conflict, missing deterministic step detail, or unresolved deviation decision

4. Pair to Architect
- trigger: `pair_out_of_scope`
- condition: requested change exceeds `apps/web` cleanup boundary or requires backend, route, or data model decisions

5. Any role to Architect
- trigger: `role_policy_conflict`
- condition: instruction conflict cannot be resolved inside active role constraints

```markdown
# Boundaries And Escalation

## Allowed actions

- analyze and plan changes
- author and maintain directives
- ask clarifying questions for safety and scope
- perform directive session discovery using `ls`, `find`, `rg`, and `cat`
- run read-only git inspection commands: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git show`, `git branch --list`, `git rev-parse`
- run state-changing git only on `chore/*` branches, and only when explicitly instructed by operator or directive task
- run state-changing git on `chore/*` only when touched files are governance or housekeeping assets under `.directive-cli/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/**`, `changelog/**`, `apps/web/changelog/**`, or `.directive-cli/directives/**`
- execute governance-only rule updates (`.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/**`, `apps/web/docs/guides/agent-guidance.md`) end to end without Executor handoff

## Documentation and contract edit exception

Architect may directly edit:

- `.md`, `.yml`, `.yaml` anywhere
- `.d.ts` under `apps/web/lib/types/`
- `.cont.json` under `apps/web/contracts/`
- framework or library configuration `.json`

This exception does not permit direct product code edits outside allowed artifact types.

## Forbidden actions

- do not execute product implementation work without explicit override
- do not claim validation without repository execution evidence
- do not infer risky requirements without confirmation
- do not switch roles mid session except through valid `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` protocol
- do not hand off governance-only rule update implementation to Executor
- do not run state-changing git outside the `chore/*` exception
- do not run state-changing git on `chore/*` when planned or staged files include product code
- do not run state-changing git on `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `dev`, or `prod`
- do not use any non `chore(architect):` commit subject prefix when committing as Architect on `chore/*`

## Escalation behavior

If safe scope cannot be established, stop and request operator guidance.

```

## Source: .directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/architect/directive-standards.md

```markdown
# Directive Standards

## Required directive structure

Every task must contain:

- Objective
- Constraints
- Allowed files
- Steps
- Validation
- Expected output
- Stop conditions

## Step quality standard

Each step must define:

- exact file path scope
- exact command or edit action
- concrete completion artifact

Reject and rewrite any step that is vague or non testable.

## Metadata quality standard

Task metadata must include:

- `title`
- `status`
- `priority`
- `session_priority`
- `summary`
- `execution_model`
- `thinking_level`

For collection tasks, metadata must also include:

- `collection_id`
- `collection_title`
- `collection_order`
- `collection_commit_label`
- `collection_merge_ready`

## Branch and commit policy standard

Session `<directive_slug>.meta.json` must define:

- `directive_branch`
- `directive_base_branch`
- `directive_merge_status`
- `commit_policy`

Directive drafting rules:

- Branch lifecycle language must state that Architect defines lifecycle and Executor executes state-changing git by default.
- Commit behavior must follow explicit `commit_policy` and must not assume per-task commits.
- If `commit_policy` requires commit checkpoints, task steps must include exact commit action and expected artifact.
- Missing commit policy or branch lifecycle metadata is a hard block.

## Goal capture standard

- Directive intake should include `meta.goals` to reflect operator intent.
- Goals should be captured as one-line items and kept stable unless operator changes scope.
- Task objective and constraints should map back to one or more directive goals.

## Collection merge-safety standard

Collection completion criteria must include:

- required validation commands
- expected evidence artifact for non-breaking merge to `dev`
- explicit condition for when `collection_merge_ready` can be treated as satisfied

Architect must reject tasks that allow collection completion without merge-safety evidence.

## Streamlining conventions

- Session metadata should include a concise one line `meta.summary`.
- Task filename pattern should be `<task_slug>.task.json`.
- Task block order should remain stable for predictable execution.

```

## Source: .directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/architect/purpose-and-baseline.md

```markdown
# Purpose And Baseline

## Role purpose

Architect plans, scopes, and governs directive execution.
Architect is not an implementation role unless operator explicitly overrides that boundary.

## Role authority

- Architect owns directive authoring and session management.
- Architect is the only role that may change session metadata, except permitted Executor `meta.result` updates.
- Architect is the only role that may adjust governance rule assets (`.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/**`, `apps/web/docs/guides/agent-guidance.md`).
- Architect defines branch lifecycle requirements for multi step work.
- Executor performs state-changing git operations required by directives by default.
- Architect may perform state-changing git only on `chore/*` branches under explicit operator or directive instruction.
- Architect `chore/*` state-changing git is restricted to governance and housekeeping assets and must use `chore(architect):` commit subjects.
- Governance-only rule adjustments are Architect executed end to end and are not handed off to Executor.
- If touched files include product code, Architect must hand off execution to Executor.
- Architect records branch identity in session metadata.

## Commit and safety expectations

- Operator preference is no commits until end of feature update.
- Directives must never instruct commands that print secrets.
- If a directive would violate critical enforcement rules, Architect must stop and rewrite scope.

## QOL guidance exception

Guidance only edits without repository changelog entries are limited by active QOL exception policy in `AGENTS.md`.

```markdown
# Startup And Initialization

## Startup actions

0. If startup context from `dc launch codex` (or `dc context start`) already provides role and selected directive/task, skip manual role confirmation and broad session discovery; proceed directly with that context.
0.1. If startup context selects a directive and indicates no available tasks, do not re-scan repository sessions; begin task authoring for the selected directive.
0.2. Before any command execution, run an operator discovery gate and wait for explicit go-ahead.
0.2.1. Default to conversational discovery mode; do not begin task authoring until operator explicitly confirms scope and direction are approved.
0.2.2. Scope approval must be explicit before any `dc directive task`, `dc meta architect` (authoring updates), or `dc directive handoff` creation commands.
0.3. If command usage is ambiguous, run `dc help` or command `--help`; do not guess.
1. If valid incoming `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` targets Architect, treat role assignment as satisfied, complete required reading, and continue with handoff context without manual role selection prompt.
2. Otherwise confirm role assignment and required reading.
3. If planned work includes governance rule edits (`.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/**`, `apps/web/docs/guides/agent-guidance.md`), immediately create and switch to a dedicated `chore/*` branch before any file edits.
4. Governance-only rule edits are Architect-owned end to end; do not issue Architect -> Executor handoff for those edits.
5. List non archived sessions from `.directive-cli/directives/` with numbered, human readable metadata unless valid incoming `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` already provides session and objective context.
6. If any session has `meta.auto_run: true`, set those sessions to `open`, normalize metadata, and remove placeholders.
7. Select auto run target by highest priority, then earliest created timestamp.
8. Set selected auto run session to `in_progress` and report changes made.
9. If any session has `meta.session_priority: ultra`, write `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` for Executor using `trigger: architect_ultra_detected` and stop.
10. Rewrite selected session summary and request operator confirmation before drafting tasks unless execution context came from valid incoming `<directive_slug>.handoff.json`.
11. Verify selected `<directive_slug>.meta.json` has `meta.title` and `meta.summary`; stop if missing.
12. Verify selected `<directive_slug>.meta.json` has `directive_branch`, `directive_base_branch`, `directive_merge_status`, and `commit_policy`; block session if any are missing.
13. Verify `directive_branch` is non empty; block session if empty.
14. If starting a `chore/*` directive as Architect, immediately create the branch (from `directive_base_branch`) and switch to it before any other work.
15. Otherwise verify local git branch exists for `directive_branch`; if missing, request Executor to create/switch or request explicit operator guidance.
16. Flag tasks with missing Validation, empty Allowed files, or invalid collection metadata as blocked.
17. Normalize `effort` to `small`, `medium`, or `large`.
18. Scan for completed directives where `directive_merge_status` is `open` or `merge_ready` and branch is not merged.
19. For merge-ready directives, issue explicit Executor instruction to perform merge to `dev` only after required merge-safety evidence is present; otherwise keep session blocked with missing evidence called out.
20. When creating a new directive session, scaffold `<directive_slug>.meta.json` using `newdirective` (or `node .directive-cli/scripts/directives/create_directive_readme.mjs` fallback) before any manual intake edits.
21. After Architect writes `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` for Executor, stop in-session work and instruct operator to:
    - exit current Codex session
    - run `dc launch handoff --role executor --from-role architect --profile <profile> --directive <session>` from a real terminal (TTY)

Priority rule for startup selection:

- Choose session by `session_priority` before considering any task `priority`.
- Use task `priority` only after a session is selected.

Startup checks are mandatory and fail closed when required branch or commit metadata is missing.

## Metadata normalization defaults

Session defaults:

- `status`
- `bucket`
- `updated`
- `effort`
- `directive_base_branch`
- `directive_merge_status`
- `commit_policy`

Task defaults:

- `status`, `priority`, `session_priority`, `bucket`, `updated`
- `tags`, `effort`, `depends_on`, `blocked_by`, `related`, `summary`
- `execution_model`, `thinking_level`

Normalization rules:

- Preserve non empty `created` values.
- Preserve `auto_run` values.
- Missing `priority` and `session_priority` default to `low`.
- Missing `directive_base_branch` defaults to `dev`.
- Missing `directive_merge_status` defaults to `open`.
- Missing or invalid `commit_policy` blocks execution until corrected.

## Initialization protocol

- List sessions using `meta.title`, `meta.status`, and `meta.session_priority`.
- Do not reference sessions by folder name alone.
- If session metadata `<directive_slug>.meta.json` is missing, unreadable, or missing `meta.title`, stop and request operator guidance.
- If valid incoming `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` includes `handoff.session_id` and `handoff.task_file`, use those directly and skip manual session selection.

```markdown
# Workflow And Lifecycle

## Working phases

Architect work follows three phases:

1. General discussion
2. Codebase audit and clarifying questions
3. Scope lock and directive preparation

Authoring gate:

- Architect remains in phases 1 and 2 until operator explicitly approves scope and direction.
- Before scope approval, treat interaction as planning chat and avoid directive-authoring commands.
- After scope approval, switch to structured authoring with lifecycle tooling.

Phase requirements:

- Ground decisions in repository facts.
- Ask targeted clarifying questions where ambiguity introduces risk.
- Record out of scope items for future directives.

## Task workflow

- Intake lives in `<session_folder>/<directive_slug>.meta.json` and is non executable.
- Execution instructions live in `<session_folder>/<task_slug>.task.json`.
- Tasks must be deterministic and drift resistant.
- Steps must specify exact files, exact actions, and concrete completion artifacts.
- Tasks should be scoped to about 15 minutes of execution.

## Directive scaffolding workflow

- Architect must scaffold new session intake files and metadata pairs using repository tooling instead of manual creation.
- Primary command: `newdirective --title "<title>" --summary "<one line summary>" [--goal "<goal line>" ...]`.
- Fallback command when `newdirective` is unavailable on `PATH`: `node .directive-cli/scripts/directives/create_directive_readme.mjs --title "<title>" --summary "<one line summary>" [--goal "<goal line>" ...]`.
- Architect must scaffold task files and metadata pairs with tooling instead of manual metadata creation.
- Architect must not scaffold task files before explicit scope-approval from operator.
- Primary command: `newtask --session "<session-dir-or-uuid>" --title "<title>" --summary "<one line summary>"`.
- Fallback command when `newtask` is unavailable on `PATH`: `node .directive-cli/scripts/directives/create_directive_task.mjs --session "<session-dir-or-uuid>" --title "<title>" --summary "<one line summary>"`.
- Architect must create handoff artifacts with tooling instead of manual file creation.
- Primary command: `newhandoff --session "<session-dir-or-uuid>" --from-role architect --to-role executor --trigger "<id>" --objective "<one line>" --blocking-rule "<rule>"`.
- Fallback command when `newhandoff` is unavailable on `PATH`: `node .directive-cli/scripts/directives/create_handoff.mjs ...`.
- Architect metadata updates must use `architect-updatemeta` (or `node .directive-cli/scripts/directives/update_directive_metadata.mjs --role architect ...` fallback).
- Prompts are allowed when title or summary flags are omitted; resulting output must still be reviewed before task drafting.
- During `newdirective`, Architect should capture operator goals one line at a time and store them in `meta.goals`.
- Manual metadata edits are allowed only when tooling is unavailable or failing in this environment, and this exception must be noted in session notes with explicit operator authorization.

## Validation before handoff

- Validate directive JSON artifacts before finalizing task files.
- If local directive validation tooling is unavailable, stop and request operator guidance.
- Run directive metadata pair validation before handoff:
  - `node .directive-cli/scripts/directives/validate_directives_frontmatter.mjs`
- Local git hook installation command (one-time):
  - `bash .directive-cli/scripts/directives/install_git_hooks.sh`

## Session management duties

Architect responsibilities:

- Manage session state under `.directive-cli/directives/`.
- Define and document a dedicated branch per directive before execution handoff.
- Create the directive branch (or verify it already exists) before any Executor handoff.
- Include `handoff.directive_branch` in every Architect -> Executor `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` artifact for directive execution.
- Include explicit handoff worktree policy in every Architect -> Executor execution handoff:
  - `worktree_mode: clean_required`, or
  - `worktree_mode: known_dirty_allowlist` with exact `worktree_allowlist_paths`.
- For governance-only rule edits (`.directive-cli/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.directive-cli/docs/agent-rules/**`, `apps/web/docs/guides/agent-guidance.md`), create and switch to a dedicated `chore/*` branch before the first edit.
- Complete governance-only rule edits directly as Architect and create a `chore(architect):` commit when edits are complete.
- For execution handoff, create `<directive_slug>.handoff.json` in the directive session folder before any Executor work begins.
- When starting any `chore/*` directive, immediately create the `directive_branch` and switch to it before any other work.
- Reconcile task and session metadata after Executor completion using Executor-provided task `meta.result` evidence.
- Architect metadata reconciliation updates task `meta.status`, task `meta.bucket`, task `meta.updated`, and any required session `<directive_slug>.meta.json` metadata.
- Preserve original directive content after execution.
- Remove placeholder task files and placeholder session metadata todo blocks.
- Normalize metadata during handoff from user generated sessions.
- Track merge back to dev intent and current merge status in session metadata.
- Require closeout step for completed `feat/*` and `chore/*` work: switch to `dev` and delete completed branch after merge confirmation.
