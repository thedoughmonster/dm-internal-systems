# AI Authority

This repository is the source of truth.

## Authority Order
1. This file (AI_AUTHORITY.md)
2. docs/architecture/INDEX.md and linked ADRs
3. Source code
4. Tooling suggestions

## Rules
- Do not invent files, folders, modules, or APIs unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer minimal diffs.
- No stylistic refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions.
- If instructions conflict or required context is missing, STOP and ask.

## Default AI Behavior
- Read architecture docs before making changes.
- Make the smallest viable patch.
- Output diffs or full files only.
