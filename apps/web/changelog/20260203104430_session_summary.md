Scope: apps/web

Summary:
- Added settings route with price change threshold editor.
- Applied stored price change threshold to vendor dashboard and price change detail view.
- Added settings icon link to top navigation.

Files Touched:
- apps/web/app/layout.tsx
- apps/web/app/settings/page.tsx
- apps/web/app/settings/composites/SettingsView.tsx
- apps/web/app/settings/lib/types.ts
- apps/web/app/settings/lib/api.ts
- apps/web/app/vendors/ingest/price-changes/composites/PriceChangesView.tsx
- apps/web/app/vendors/page.tsx

Decisions:
- Stored threshold as a percent value in app settings and converted to decimal at query time.
- Rendered settings editing in a client composite with inline validation.

Risks and Followups:
- Settings page depends on edge function availability for writes.
- Large price history queries may need pagination or batching later.
