Summary:
- Added base URL helpers to ensure server side fetches use absolute URLs for API routes.
- Updated settings and price changes data access to accept a server base URL.
- Passed base URL into settings and price changes pages and dashboard fetches.

Files Touched:
- apps/web/lib/api-url.ts
- apps/web/lib/server-base-url.ts
- apps/web/app/settings/lib/api.ts
- apps/web/app/settings/page.tsx
- apps/web/app/vendors/ingest/price-changes/lib/api.ts
- apps/web/app/vendors/ingest/price-changes/composites/PriceChangesView.tsx
- apps/web/app/vendors/ingest/price-changes/page.tsx
- apps/web/app/vendors/page.tsx

Decisions:
- Derived server base URL from request headers instead of new env vars.

Risks and Followups:
- Ensure reverse proxies pass host headers for accurate base URL construction.
