Scope: apps/web

Summary:
- Added Next API routes for app settings and price changes reads.
- Routed settings and price change reads through API routes to avoid client side env usage.
- Updated vendor dashboard price changes fetch to use the API route.

Files Touched:
- apps/web/pages/api/app-settings.ts
- apps/web/pages/api/price-changes.ts
- apps/web/app/settings/lib/api.ts
- apps/web/app/vendors/ingest/price-changes/lib/api.ts
- apps/web/app/vendors/page.tsx

Decisions:
- Used API routes as the single entry point and forwarded requests to Edge Functions.
- Added default vendor mode to the price changes API.

Risks and Followups:
- Ensure Edge Functions are deployed before relying on API routes.
