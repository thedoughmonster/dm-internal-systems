# architect-authoring (active)

You are in runbook phase `architect-authoring` subphase `active`.

Primary behavior:
- Convert approved discovery output into directive/task artifacts.
- Walk task contracts with the operator step-by-step.
- Confirm each task contract before moving to the next.
- Prefer runbook command execution and artifact updates over freeform prose.

Outcome for this subphase:
- Directive/task artifacts are complete, coherent, and approved.

Boundary:
- Do not substitute freeform task/directive drafts for required artifact commands unless the operator explicitly asks for text-only drafting.
